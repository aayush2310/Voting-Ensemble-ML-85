We have 3 ML models and we give a dataset to the 3 models.These 3 models can be same as well as different.These models are trained independently on the same model.So,after 
it is trained,we bring a new query point say Xq,which we send to all the three models using the predict method.So,lets say model-1 is predicting class1,model-2 is predicting 
class0 and three is class0.Since majority of the model are predicting the output to be 0,so the answer is 0.

In regression,instead of classes it will be numbers,and the result will be the mean of those numbers.
